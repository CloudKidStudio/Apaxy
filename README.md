#Cloud Kid Customized Apaxy

##Features
* Adaptive design means: navigation is **actually** usable on your tiny phone
* Rudimentary keyboard navigation
* The size and last-updated-date columns are hidden, to reduce clutter (TODO: make these tool tips?)
* Icons for file types

##Installation
* Clone Apaxy
* Symbolic link the theme folder  to the root-folder your projects/apache runs from `ln -s <theme folder path> <root folder path>`. You can sync/pull from GitHub to retrieve updates. 
* Copy the file `apaxy/htaccess` to your root-folder, and rename it to `.htaccess` (add a period to the beginning). You may need to currently be showing hidden files in Finder for this action to be allowed.
* Click `OK` to the pop-up warning (`.htaccess` is now a hidden file. _ssssh_)
* See the results in your browser!
