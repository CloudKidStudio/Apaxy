#Cloud Kid Customized Apaxy

##Features
* Adaptive design means: navigation is **actually** usable on your tiny phone
* Rudimentary keyboard navigation
* The size and last-updated-date columns are hidden, to reduce clutter (TODO: make these tool tips?)
* Icons for file types

##Simple Installation
* Download and unzip Apaxy
* Move the contents of the `/apaxy` folder to the root-folder your projects/apache runs from
* Rename the file `htaccess` to `.htaccess` (add a period to the beginning)
* Click `OK` to the pop-up warning (`.htaccess` is now a hidden file. _ssssh_)
* See the results in your browser!

##Better Installation
* Clone Apaxy 
* Symbolic link the theme folder  to the root-folder your projects/apache runs from `ln -s <theme folder path> <root folder path>`. You can sync/pull from GitHub to retrieve updates. 
* Move *only* the file `htaccess` to your root-folder, and rename it to `.htaccess` (add a period to the beginning)
* Click `OK` to the pop-up warning (`.htaccess` is now a hidden file. _ssssh_)
* See the results in your browser!
