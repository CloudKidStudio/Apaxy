#Cloud Kid Customized Apaxy

##Features
* Adaptive design means: navigation is **actually** usable on your tiny phone
* Rudimentary keyboard navigation
* The size and last-updated-date columns are hidden, to reduce clutter (TODO: make these tool tips?)
* Icons for file types

##Installation
* Download and unzip Apaxy
* Move the contents of the `/apaxy` folder to the root-folder your projects/apache runs from
* Rename the file `htaccess` to `.htaccess` (add a period to the beginning)
* Click `OK` to the pop-up warning (`.htaccess` is now a hidden file. _ssssh_)
* See the results in your browser!
